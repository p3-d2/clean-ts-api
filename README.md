# **Clean Node API**

That api is part of teacher Rodrigo Manguinho training at Udemy

The objective of the training is to show how to create an API with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) as a working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
